            <p class="primary--color active">Every year, millions of girls and boys around the world face sexual abuse and exploitation. Sexual violence occurs everywhere – in every country and across all segments of society. A child may be subjected to sexual abuse or exploitation at
                home, at school or in their community, such as the cases of Jennifer andd Aminat at about 7pm Nigerian time in Gwa-gwalada, Abuja which brought these Agency to life. The widespread use of digital technologies can also put children at risk.The
                Child Right violation and Abuse Agency was established to curb these nefarious acts and bring to book the offenders.
                <br> At least 120 million girls under the age of 20 – about 1 in 10 – have been forced to engage in sex or perform other sexual acts, although the actual figure is likely much higher. Roughly 90 per cent of adolescent girls who report
                forced sex say that their first perpetrator was someone they knew, usually a boyfriend or a husband. But many victims of sexual violence, including millions of boys, never tell anyone. About 1 in 10 girls under the age of 20 have been
                forced to engage in sex or perform other sexual acts.
            </p>
            <p class="primary-color active">Although sexual violence occurs everywhere, risks surge in emergency contexts. During armed conflict, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies, women and children are especially vulnerable to sexual violence – including conflict-related
                sexual violence, intimate partner violence and trafficking for sexual exploitation – as well as other forms of gender-based violence. Sexual violence results in severe physical, psychological and social harm. Victims experience an increased
                risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, pain, illness, unwanted pregnancy, social isolation and psychological trauma. Some victims may resort to risky behaviours like substance abuse to cope with trauma. And as child victims
                reach adulthood, sexual violence can reduce their ability to care for themselves and others. While sexual violence is fundamentally a crime of power, it is increasingly driven by economic motives. The internet has opened a rapidly growing
                global market for the production, distribution and consumption of child sexual abuse materials, such as photographs and videos. When online, children may be susceptible to sexual coercion and in-contact sexual abuse by offenders who attempt
                to extort them for content and financial gain. The harmful norms that perpetuate sexual violence take a heavy toll on families and communities too. Most children who face sexual abuse experience other kinds of violence. And as abuse and
                exploitation become entrenched, progress towards development and peace can stall – with consequences for entire societies.</p>
